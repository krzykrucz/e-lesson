## Overview
##### Used practices:
* Domain-driven design
* Pure functional programming
* Behaviour-driven testing (BDD)
* Event storming
* Clean hexagonal architecture

##### Tech stack:
* Kotlin with Spring Boot in production
* Spock, ArchUnit in testing

##### The process:
1. Big Picture event storming
2. Design Level event storming
3. Define ubiquitous language in code (types + workflows)
4. Story definition in behaviour-driven way (specs)
5. Implement domain logic to fulfill test specs
6. GOTO step 3/4

## Event storming
