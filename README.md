# E-Lesson (functional DDD showcase)

## Exercise #5: Be Explicit!

This exercise will show you how to use types to enforce as much constraints as possible.

### Exercise description

- Go to [CurrentLesson.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/krzykrucz/elesson/currentlesson/domain/CurrentLesson.kt)
- Figure out how to use data types to enforce more constraints in fragments labeled as TODO
- Create smart constructor for `LessonHourNumber`

1. When in doubt - ask domain expert.
2. Ask your self if given data types is too broad. For example, can teacher's name be empty?
